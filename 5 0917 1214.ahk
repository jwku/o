T: Timeout. To have the message box close automatically if the user has not closed it within a specified time, use the letter T followed by the timeout in seconds, which can contain a decimal point. If this value exceeds 2147483 (24.8 days), it will be set to 2147483. If the message box times out, the return value is the word Timeout.
